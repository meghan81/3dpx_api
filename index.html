The NIH 3D Print Exchange (“3DPX” for short) houses biomedically-relevant 3D models, which anyone can interact with in a browser-based viewer or download and print on a 3D printer. Our APIs allow developers to access this content – in both XML and JSON format – for integration into their own tools. To learn more about the NIH 3D Print Exchange, please visit (http://3dprint.nih.gov).

## Getting Started
We organized this site into a few major sections:

* API Basics: Learn the operations offered by the API.
* API Calls: Practice with the API operations using interactive tools.
